# YelpCamp
### This web application was built from an online web development bootcamp I recently went through. The application is meant to be a Yelp-like website specializing in campgrounds. You can visit the site [here](https://glacial-river-12191.herokuapp.com/).


The Tools and Technologies used in the application includes (*but is not limited to*):
* **JavaScript**
* **NodeJS**
* **MongoDB**
* **ExpressJS**
* **Bootstrap**
* **HTML5**
* **CSS3**
